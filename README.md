## Installation

There are 2 ways to install **Minimalcord**.
#### Import (Recomended)
This way includes automatic updates and is easier to install. Add the following to the top of your *Quick CSS* page. This also includes automatic updates.
```css
@import url("https://raw.githack.com/Chromus-dev/Minimalcord/master/minimalcord.css");
```
#### Git Clone
This way **does not** include automatic updates and isn't as easy to install. To install head over to your themes folder, open a command prompt / powershell / terminal / or git bash and enter the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/Chromus-dev/Minimalcord.git
```

## Addons
#### Custom Colors  
This addon adds some nice new colors to [discord](https://discord.com/ "discord").

Add the following to the top of your *Quick CSS* page. This will include automatic updates.
```css
@import url("https://raw.githack.com/Chromus-dev/Minimalcord/master/Addons/customColorsAddon.css");
```

#### display: none;
This addon removes things that I consider "useless".

Add the following to the top of your *Quick CSS* page. This will include automatic updates.
